# SMDH message schema registry

This repository contains schemas for various sensors deployed by different Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Currently, all the streaming sensor data is in JSON format, necessitating the development of JSON schemas. These schemas play a crucial role in validating the sensor data at the cloud, ensuring its integrity and adherence to predefined structures.

### Registered SMEs and sensor data
